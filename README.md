# Booking.com Data Scraper
This is a data scraper designed to pull hotel data from the booking.com website. The data was first pulled from the website, then cleaned, and then used to create a regression model.  
A final report and presentation was made for my B365 class.

## Features
- The python libraries pandas and beautiful soup were used to pull data from the website and stored into a csv file
- Used selenium and chromedriver to simulate and handle page cycling
- Cleaned data - removed missing data and outliers
- Used matplotlib to generate a linear regression
